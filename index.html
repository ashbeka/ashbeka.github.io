    <p>It's been a long time since I last practiced code, around 2 years. I spent these two years trying to survive a genocide.
       I'm trying to get the gears running again, practicing code's basics here and there, I lost access to my old computer
       where I kept most of my projects, I'll retain access to my old projects and push them here at some point.
       This is a fresh new start, a [re]start.
